# [Escape-AI](https://godiecuriel.itch.io/escape-ai)
Escape-AI is a first-person shooter game set in an apocalyptic scenario. The game features a unique mechanic that allows time to freeze when the player is not moving. The objective of the game is to survive and reach the car at the end of the map to win. If the player fails to reach the car within 60 seconds, they will lose.


The player should be careful to avoid the AI-controlled enemies that will try to stop them. The game provides the player with three lives, and they will lose a life if they are hit by an enemy. The player can shoot at the enemies by pressing the spacebar and move around using the WASD keys.
